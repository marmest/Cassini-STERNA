<h1>STERNA</h1>
Sterna will use data from Copernicus, Galileo and EGNOS, Earth observation programmes developed by the European Space Agency (ESA), to identify available terrain on borders where immigrants can cross. We will leverage the data to create a heatmap of the border area, identifying areas where illegal border crossings are likely to occure, based on terrain availability. This information will be used to inform border control agencies and other relevant organizations in the European Union, allowing them to allocate resources more effectively and prevent illegal border crossings. Software will also suggest alternative paths immigrants can take using the heatmap. Data, such as elevation, type of land and similar, will be used to classify terrain availability and consequently create heatmap which will correspond with terrain availability.
